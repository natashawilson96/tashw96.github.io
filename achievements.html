            <h2>KNOWLEDGE OF HTML & CSS</h2>
            After submitting a successful application I was accepted onto 'Code First: Girl' 's Introduction to Web Development Course. Over 8 weeks I was given an insight into HTML and CSS (and briefly Javascript). <br> These new skills are how I have been able to create this website from scratch.<br> I received a certificate for my work.

                <h2>FRENCH & ITALIAN SKILLS</h2>
                I am educated to a University level (B2/C1) in both French & Italian speaking, reading and writing.<br>
                I am experienced (final year modules) in translating large French & Italian texts to English and vice versa. <br> 
                More than anything, these skills have taught me the importance of clear communication.

            <h2>BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE COURSE</h2>
            I am currently learning British Sign Language through an online course. <br>Having such a love for languages I find it awful that British Sign Language is not offered in schools. As a country we are eager to offer a variety of modern foreign languages, ranaging from French to Russian, to secondary school children but alienate the 151,000 BSL users in the UK by not offering to teach their own language in schools.
